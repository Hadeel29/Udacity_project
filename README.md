# Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree

This repository contains projects and practice exercises from the **Udacity Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree**.

## Project 1: SQL for Movie Rentals

### Overview
In this project, I explored a provided movie rental database by running SQL queries and creating visualizations to present the query results.

For the presentation component, I developed four slides, each containing:
- A question of interest
- The SQL query used to answer the question
- A visualization based on the query results
- A brief summary of findings

### Project Submission
Project submission includes the completed analysis and presentation.

### Question Sets
Udacity provided a set of suggested questions, which I considered while working on my project.

## Project 2: Python Data Exploration for Bikeshare Systems

### Overview
This project involved analyzing bikeshare data from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Using Python, I:
- Imported and processed the data
- Computed descriptive statistics to answer interesting questions
- Developed an interactive CLI program that allows users to explore the dataset dynamically

### Project Submission
The CLI application enables users to filter the dataset by city, month, and weekday to view relevant statistics. It also provides options to:
- View raw data
- Sort data by columns in ascending or descending order

### Python Learning Resources
I compiled useful learning materials from the course.

### Files Used
To run this program, the following datasets are required:
- `washington.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `chicago.csv`

### Requirements
This project was built using **Python 3.7.1** and the following libraries:
- `pandas==0.23.4`
- `numpy==1.15.4`

## Project 3: Version Control with Git and GitHub

### Overview
This project involved using Git and GitHub to refactor Project 2, following a simulated workflow.

### Project Submission
For submission, I completed a template documenting all the Git commands used to perform the required tasks.
